The 'Thunk' API provides a way to defer potentially recursive computations:

* 'thunk' is lazy in its argument, and does not run it directly
* the first 'force' triggers execution of the action passed to thunk
* that action is run at most once, and returns a list of other thunks
* 'force' forces these thunks as well, and does not return before all of them have executed
* Cycles are allowed: The action passed to 'thunk' may return a thunk whose action returns the first thunk.

The implementation is hopefully thread safe: Even if multiple threads force or
kick related thunks, all actions are still run at most once, and all calls to
force terminate (no deadlock).

>>> :set -XRecursiveDo
>>> :{
  mdo t1 <- thunk $ putStrLn "Hello" >> pure [t1, t2]
      t2 <- thunk $ putStrLn "World" >> pure [t1, t2]
      putStrLn "Nothing happened so far, but now:"
      force t1
      putStrLn "No more will happen now:"
      force t1
      putStrLn "That's it"
:}
Nothing happened so far, but now:
Hello
World
No more will happen now:
That's it
